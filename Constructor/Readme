								Constructor


->	Class name and Constructor name should be Same

-> They are 2 types of Classes 
A.Default constructors
B.Parameterized constructors

-> We can Access constructors while creation of objects

-> Constructors are mainly for initializing.

-> Constructors doesnâ€™t have any returntype not even void also.if we declare as 
   a void the compiler will consider it as a method not as a constructors.
   
-> Every class needs atleast one Constructors.

->Always constructors are overloaded.

->this and super keyword.
		this---- keyword is always pointing to instance variable.
                        this can be use to call one constructor to another constructor (within a class)
        Super----- Keyword always it will call super class constructor 
        
-> Copy Constructor ----- Object reference is copied & calls the constructor
